<p> I have a tremendous passion for graphic design;
my concentration is in logo design, identity and branding. I enjoy the creative process that goes into the design and the challenge that comes along with the development. As well as the collaborative process and introducing my own creative spin. My work helps people learn and understand; it also can move and guide people. I can craft an easy but creative way to understand the information. My work is about new creative approaches to ideas. They are original, diverse and can appeal to a broad spectrum. The designs I create are modern and fresh but have a timeless feel to them. I enjoy working with others but also enjoy working independently and I am always up for a new design challenge! </p>
